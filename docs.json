Also provides focus toggling between splitview \"halves\" and ability to close a fullscreen or split desktop by keyboard. Requires MacOS>=10.15\nImportant points:\n* `SplitView` relies on the undocumented `spaces` API, and the separate accessibility ui `axuielement`; which _must_ both be installed for it to work; see https://github.com/asmagill/hs._asm.undocumented.spaces and https://github.com/asmagill/hs._asm.axuielement/, \n* This tool works by _simulating_ the split-view user interface: a long green-button click followed by a 2nd window click.  This requires some time delays to work reliably.  If it is unreliable for you, trying increasing these (see `delay*` variables in the reference below).\n* `SplitView` uses `hw.window.filter` to try to ignore atypical windows (menu panes, etc.), which see.  Unrecognized non-standard windows may interfere with `SplitView`'s operation.\n\n*Download*: [https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/SplitView.spoon.zip]\nExample config in your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:\n```\nmash =      {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\"}\nmashshift = {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\",\"shift\"}\n-- SplitView for Split Screen \nhs.spoons.use(\"SplitView\",\n\t      {config = {tileSide=\"right\"},\n\t       hotkeys={choose={mash,\"e\"},\n\t       \t\t\tchooseAppEmacs={mashshift,\"e\",\"Emacs\"},\n\t       \t\t\tchooseAppWin130={mashshift,\"o\",\"Terminal\",\"130\"},\n\t       \t\t\tremoveDesktop={mashshift,\"k\"},\n\t       \t\t\tswapWindows={mashshift,\"x\"},\n\t       \t\t\tswitchFocus={mash,\"x\"}}})\n```\nVersion 1.7.0",

This requires some time delays to work reliably.  If it is unreliable for you, trying increasing these (see `delay*` variables in the reference below).\n* `SplitView` uses `hw.window.filter` to try to ignore atypical windows (menu panes, etc.), which see.  Unrecognized non-standard windows may interfere with `SplitView`'s operation.\n\n*Download*: [https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/SplitView.spoon.zip]\nExample config in your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:\n```\nmash =      {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\"}\nmashshift = {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\",\"shift\"}\n-- SplitView for Split Screen \nhs.spoons.use(\"SplitView\",\n\t      {config = {tileSide=\"right\"},\n\t       hotkeys={choose={mash,\"e\"},\n\t       \t\t\tchooseAppEmacs={mashshift,\"e\",\"Emacs\"},\n\t       \t\t\tchooseAppWin130={mashshift,\"o\",\"Terminal\",\"130\"},\n\t       \t\t\tremoveDesktop={mashshift,\"k\"},\n\t       \t\t\tswapWindows={mashshift,\"x\"},\n\t       \t\t\tswitchFocus={mash,\"x\"}}})\n```\nVersion 1.7.0",
