This requires some time delays to work reliably.  If it is unreliable for you, trying increasing these (see `delay*` variables in the reference below).\n* `SplitView` uses `hw.window.filter` to try to ignore atypical windows (menu panes, etc.), which see.  Unrecognized non-standard windows may interfere with `SplitView`'s operation.\n\n*Download*: [https://github.com/Hammerspoon/Spoons/raw/master/Spoons/SplitView.spoon.zip]\nExample config in your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:\n```\nmash =      {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\"}\nmashshift = {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\",\"shift\"}\nhs.loadSpoon(\"SplitView\",true) -- add to global, so we can access from command line\nspoon.SplitView:bindHotkeys({choose={mash,\"e\"},\n\t\t\t     chooseAppEmacs={mashshift,\"e\",\"Emacs\"},\n\t\t\t     chooseAppWin130={mashshift,\"o\",\"Terminal\",\"130\"},\n\t\t\t     switchFocus={mash,\"x\"},\n\t\t\t     removeDesktop={mashshift,\"x\"}})\n```",
