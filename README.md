![SplitView in Action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jdtsmith/SplitView/master/sv.png)

`SplitView` is a [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org) Spoon which can automate the painful chore of putting two windows side by side in MacOS's fullscreen split-view mode.  Using it is simple: just navigate to the first window you'd like in the split view, invoke the assigned key shortcut, choose another window from the popup (with search and shortcuts; see above), and then watch the magic happen. You can also create special bindings to search by application and/or window name, or even invoke `SplitView` from the command line.  And as a bonus, you can bind shortcut keys to toggle focus while in split view from one side to the other, swap the two Split View windows left and right, or remove a full screen space (single or split-view).

Important points:
* `SplitView` relies on the undocumented `spaces` API.  This _must_ be installed for `SplitView` to work; see https://github.com/asmagill/hs._asm.undocumented.spaces.  This extension relies on undocumented behavior, so caveat splitviewor. Requires Hammerspoon v0.9.79 or later and works on MacOS 10.15 or later
* This tool works by _simulating_ the split-view user interface: a long green-button click followed by a 2nd window click on the chosen miniature window.  This requires a one short time delay to work reliably (to wait for mini-windows to move fully into position).  If this is unreliable for you (e.g. if you get max iteration errors), trying increasing this (see `delay` variable in [the reference](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jdtsmith/SplitView/blob/master/html/SplitView.html).
* `SplitView` uses `hw.window.filter` to try to ignore atypical windows (menu panes, etc.), which see.  Unrecognized non-standard windows may interfere with `SplitView`'s operation.
* In addition to the normal `choose` binding, you can bind numerous additional hotkeys to customize which windows are considered for split-view.  You can also specify bindings for special commands `removeDesktop`, `swapWindows`, and `switchFocus` (see [`bindHotkeys` docs](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jdtsmith/SplitView/blob/master/html/SplitView.html#bindHotkeys)).

Example config in your `~/.hammerspoon/init.lua`:
```

mash =      {"ctrl", "cmd"}
mashshift = {"ctrl", "cmd","shift"}
-- SplitView for Split Screen 
hs.spoons.use("SplitView",
	      {config = {tileSide="right"},
	       hotkeys={choose={mash,"e"},
	       		chooseAppEmacs={mashshift,"e","Emacs"},
	       		chooseAppWin130={mashshift,"o","Terminal","130"},
	       		removeDesktop={mashshift,"k"},
	       		swapWindows={mashshift,"x"},
	       		switchFocus={mash,"x"}}})
```

In words, this sets Cmd-Ctrl-e to invoke normal (all window) `SplitView`, Cmd-Ctrl-o to `SplitView` the current window with a window of the Terminal application with "130" in its window title, Cmd-Ctrl-Shift-k to close the the split-view (or fullscreen) space, Cmd-Ctrl-Shift-x to swap the split-view windows left to right, and Cmd-Ctrl-x to switch focus between split view windows.  

To install, just [download](https://github.com/jdtsmith/SplitView/releases/latest) `SplitView.spoon.zip` and double-click it!
See [the docs](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jdtsmith/SplitView/blob/master/html/SplitView.html) for complete information on configuring `SplitView`.
